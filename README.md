## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @annabelle-josie

Iâ€™m an Undergraduate Student studying Computer Science at the University of Exeter. I'm working towards becoming a Software Engineer, and currently applying for my year-long Industrial Placement!

### Languages
I've worked with lots of different languages, the ones I use the most are:
- Python (including ML libraries, Flask and pygame)
- Java
- React.js (along with HTML, CSS and Javascript)

I'll also be learning languages in the C family this year
